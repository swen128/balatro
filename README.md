## How to Play

**Goal**: Score enough points to defeat each blind by playing poker hands with your cards.

**Game Flow**:
1. **Draw Cards**: Start each round with 8 cards
2. **Select Cards**: Choose up to 5 cards to play as a poker hand
3. **Score Points**: Earn points based on your poker hand and card values
4. **Meet the Goal**: Reach the required score before running out of hands
5. **Progress**: Defeat Small Blind â†’ Big Blind â†’ Boss Blind to advance

**Poker Hands** (from weakest to strongest):
- High Card, Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind
- Straight, Flush, Full House, Four of a Kind
- Straight Flush, Royal Flush

**Blind Types**:
- **Small Blind**: Basic challenge (1x scoring)
- **Big Blind**: Harder challenge (1.5x scoring requirement)
- **Boss Blind**: Hardest challenge (2x scoring) with special effects like:
  - The Club/Diamond/Heart/Spade: Debuff cards of specific suits
  - The Fish: Cards start face down
  - The Arm: Decrease level of played poker hands
