# RoundContainer Refactoring Analysis

## Summary

We attempted to refactor RoundContainer using two different state management approaches, but both conflicted with our strict functional programming and TypeScript rules.

## Approaches Attempted

### 1. Jotai Implementation

**Why it failed:**
- Jotai's atom setters return `void` by design
- Our ESLint rules forbid void-returning functions (`functional/no-return-void`)
- This is a fundamental architectural mismatch

**Key Issues:**
```typescript
// Jotai requires this pattern
export const handleCardClickAtom = atom(
  null,
  (get, set, cardId: string) => {  // ❌ ESLint: Function must return a value
    // setter logic
  }
);
```

### 2. Functional Reducer Pattern

**Why it failed:**
- Requires type assertions for effect payloads
- Our ESLint rules forbid type assertions (`@typescript-eslint/consistent-type-assertions`)
- Conditional statements require else branches with returns

**Key Issues:**
```typescript
// Processing effects requires type assertions
const payload = effect.payload as { handType: string; score: number }; // ❌ ESLint: No type assertions

// Conditional effects need else branches
if (condition) {  // ❌ ESLint: Must have else branch
  // side effect
}
```

## Root Cause

Our project has extremely strict functional programming rules that conflict with common React state management patterns:

1. **No void returns**: Every function must return a value
2. **No type assertions**: All types must be inferred or explicitly typed
3. **Exhaustive conditionals**: All if statements must have else branches
4. **No mutations**: All state updates must be immutable

These rules make it difficult to use:
- Libraries with imperative APIs (Jotai, Zustand)
- Effect-based patterns (Redux-style middleware)
- React's own patterns (useEffect, event handlers)

## Current Solution

The existing `RoundContainer` implementation uses `useState` and `useEffect` in a way that complies with our rules by:
- Returning cleanup functions from effects
- Using exhaustive conditionals
- Avoiding type assertions
- Working within React's constraints

## Recommendations

1. **Keep the current implementation**: It works correctly and follows our rules
2. **Focus on smaller refactorings**: Extract more logic into pure functions
3. **Consider rule adjustments**: If we want to use modern state management, we may need to relax some rules
4. **Document patterns**: Create approved patterns for common scenarios

## Lessons Learned

1. Strict functional programming rules can conflict with ecosystem libraries
2. Not all refactoring improves code - sometimes the current solution is appropriate
3. Architecture decisions should consider tool constraints
4. Type safety and functional purity sometimes require trade-offs
