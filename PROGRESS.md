# Progress Report - Balatro Implementation

## Summary
The Balatro card game implementation is now feature-complete with all core game mechanics and most planned features implemented. The codebase follows strict TypeScript standards with no `any` types, no type assertions (except for JSON parsing), and no type guards allowed.

## Completed Features

### Core Game Mechanics ✅
- **Full game flow**: Main menu → Blind selection → Round gameplay → Shop → Repeat
- **Poker hand evaluation**: All 10 hand types with proper ranking
- **Scoring system**: Base chips + multipliers with visual feedback
- **Blind progression**: Small, Big, and Boss blinds with increasing difficulty
- **Ante system**: Progressive difficulty scaling

### Advanced Features ✅
1. **Boss Blind Effects**
   - The Window: First hand scores 0 chips
   - The Hook: Discards 2 random cards per hand
   - The Ox: Playing the most frequent hand type sets money to $0

2. **Shop System**
   - Purchasable upgrades (hand size, hands per round, discards)
   - Joker cards with 35 different effects
   - Card packs (Standard, Arcana, Spectral)
   - Vouchers for shop discounts
   - Spectral cards for card enhancements

3. **Card Enhancements**
   - Foil: +50 chips when scored
   - Holographic: +10 multiplier when scored
   - Polychrome: x1.5 multiplier when scored

4. **Game Features**
   - Discard mechanic (3 discards per round by default)
   - Skip blind functionality
   - Card pack selection modal
   - Deck viewer with filtering
   - Save/load system using localStorage
   - Animated score counter
   - Card animations (dealing, playing, discarding)
   - Chip/mult bonus overlays

5. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Feature-based directory organization
   - Poker hand evaluation display in sidebar
   - Three-blind display at selection screen
   - Stable layout (no shifting when selecting cards)
   - Visual card states and animations

## Architecture Highlights

### TypeScript Strictness
- Maximum strictness enabled including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
- No `any` types allowed
- No type assertions (except saveGame.ts for JSON)
- No type guards - using discriminated unions instead
- All function parameters and returns explicitly typed

### Design Patterns
- **Immutable State**: All state updates create new objects
- **Discriminated Unions**: Type-safe state transitions
- **Pure Functions**: All game logic is pure and testable
- **Container/Presentation**: Clear separation of logic and UI
- **Feature-based Organization**: Related code colocated

### State Management
```
GameState (discriminated union)
├── MainMenuState
├── SelectingBlindState  
├── PlayingRoundState
│   └── RoundState (discriminated union)
│       ├── DrawingState
│       ├── SelectingHandState
│       ├── PlayingHandState
│       ├── ScoringState
│       ├── PlayedState
│       └── RoundFinishedState
└── ShoppingState
```

## Remaining Tasks

### Architecture
- **Boss Effect Refactoring**: Implement typed effect system with timing phases (see DESIGN_DECISIONS.md)

### Features
- **Statistics Tracking**: Games played, wins, best scores, most used hands
- **Achievement System**: Unlockable achievements
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback

### Polish
- **Performance**: React.memo optimization
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile support
- **Error Handling**: Error boundaries
